# Reflection

## Advice to self If I do a project like this again

If I were to begin this project again I would do a few things differently. The main thing I would do differently is to stick to what I've been learning and show my understanding
that way. My idea for this project was to learn something completely new (& difficult) and then to implement my skills into this new knowledge and it blew up in my face. I spent
around a week and a half learning all about 3d renderering and skyboxes and etcetra, then spent another week trying to build a skybox. I came very close (about one line away!) but
to no avail. I should have used my class time a lot more wisely, perhaps by working instead of learning, and my ideas for the future should be a little less ambitious. Or: if my 
ideas happen to be ambitious, spend more time on them (at home).

## Hardest Part of Project

The hardest part of my project was definitely the skybox, without question. I took a stab at something new so of course challenges were gonna come my way. As I said before, I spent
a long, long time working on it and still couldn't get it to work. The second portion of my game (blackjack) was difficult but doable, especially since I made a blackjack game in
Python in Comp Sci. 20.

## Did you Complete the Needs to Have List?

Almost, but unfortunately not. I did not have time to implement sound.

## Most Proud of

Although it was a failure, I am proud of myself for trying something new. Considering I was very close to making a working skybox, if I put more time than I did outside of class I
probably would have a much greater chance at success.
